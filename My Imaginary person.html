<p>Best Friends means different things to different people. Some insist that you can have only one best friend. Others assert that the<br> have best friends for different aspects of their personalities.

    Whatever the precise definition, your best friend is the person who gets you. They understand who you are and what you are saying.<br> The greatest distance cannot separate best friends. You will always feel a kinship
     with them, and be able to<br> instantly continue the friendship even after not talking for many years.
    <br>
    Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look out for <br>your best interest.
     This kind of friend can be hard to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may not be <br>quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought <br>
    about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.
